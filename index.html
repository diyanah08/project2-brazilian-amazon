                    <p>The charts above show that most of the fires occur during the month of September.</p>
                    <p>Forest fires are common in the Amazon during the dry season, which runs from July to October. They can be caused by naturally occurring events, such as lightning strikes. However, it can also be started by farmers and loggers clearing
                        land for crops or grazing.</p>
                    <p>The Brazilian NGO IPAM (Institute of Environmental Research in Amazonia) notes that more and more fires are not a consequence of a lack of rain but rather the dileberate deforestation of the area. Fires are a common last stage of the
                        deforestation process in the Amazon region where trees are cut, wood are left behind to dry and later burned so that the ashes can fertilize the soil. When the rains come, pasture grass flourishes in the short term from the nutrients
                        left by the ashes.</p>
                    <p>These fires have adverse effects on the environment, athmosphere and biodiversity. Though the fires may fertilise the soil in the short-term, the spread of fires causes the tree cover to decrease and the carbon emission to increase
                        tremendously.

                    <p>The fires are emitting large amounts of smoke and carbon. Plumes of smoke from the fires have spread across the Amazon region and beyond. The fires have been not only been releasing a large amount of carbon dioxide but emitting carbon
                        monoxide as well.</p>
                    <p>The Amazon basin - home to about three million species of plants and animals, and one million indigenous people - is crucial to regulating global warming, with its forests absorbing millions of tonnes of carbon every year. However,
                        when trees are cut or burned, the carbon they are storing is released into the atmosphere and the rainforest's capacity to absorb carbon is reduced.</p>
